# handcricket
Simple python program for the handcricket game, with GUI
The aim of this mini project is to play the “Handcricket” game against a computer as opponent. The game starts off with a toss, and the player can either choose heads or tails. If he chooses correctly, he can choose whether to bat or bowl first, otherwise the computer will pick one at random. After the toss has concluded, the player plays either batting or bowling, according to the choice. He selects a number from 1 to 6, and the computer does the same. If both the numbers are the same, the batsman is out. Then they swap sides and repeat the procedure. After both teams are out, the team with the higher score wins.
